# tic-tac-toe

## Project Details
This two player tic-tac-toe app focused on testing my knowledge of ES6 modules, scope and using as little global code as possible.

## Project Challenges
Thinking compartmentally was rather difficult at first, and sharing logic between modules was a frustrating issue that sent me scouring Google for information many times. I found myself also struggling with appending elements to the DOM & related arrays as well as I was still new to DOM manipulation.

## Project Lessons
Through this project I became much more competent using factory functions, different use cases of arrays, and DOM manipulation. It was also the biggest test of logical thinking up to that point and allowed me to grow as a developer by thinking through the series of game events between two human players.
